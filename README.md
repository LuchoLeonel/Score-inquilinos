## Why this project?
In my country, Argentina, we have a problem with people who want to rent an aparment or a house. They need to make an attachment of their houses or their cars as a warranty for the owner. The problem is that they haven't a house of their own or this proccess costs money they don't have.
Also, the price of the rent has increse because of the bad regulation of the rents in Argentina.
So, my idea is to identify those people that always pays rent in order to make less expensive their experience looking for an apartment. As the bank has a credit history of their customers, this scoring of renters looks the same: identify those who are good customers.


## My web page, Scoring Inquilinos, is a web where owners can score their renters. This allows the renters to have a reputation that improves their chances to rent an aparment.

### The web allows people to:
* register as owner, renter or both
* change their password
* update their profile
* make a description of their profile
* upload an image of theirself
* if you are a renter you can allow a owner to score you
* if you are a owner you can score a renter
* when you score a renter you can make comments

### The web page:
* Has an option to show a list of users (owners, renters, or those who are neither owner neither renter) and an option to show a list of only renters.
* Has an option to search for a particular user if you have his/her username, name, lastname or dni (Number of indentification here in Argentina).
* Has an option to enter to your own profile if you are logged-in.
* Displays the profile of the user if you click on his/her display-box.
* Shows al the data of the users, including a description, if he/she is a owner, a renter, both or neither owner or renter. Also, displays the photo the user selected as a profile photo.
* if the user is a renters shows the average score and all the scoring that other people made, including comments.
* if you are a owner and enter you enter into the profile of a renter that you already scored, it displays the score number you give him/her.
